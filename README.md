# SDE Third Assignment Delivery - Server 
#### Gabriele Scarton
###### gabriele.scarton@studenti.unitn.it
This is the server for the third assignment for IntroSDE course at Unitn.
The goal of the assignment is to create a SOAP service composed by a server and a test client.
The server is deployed on Heroku at **sde3-2017-scarton.herokuapp.com**
The client is deployed on the GitHub repository **introsde-2017-assignment-3-client**

##  The code structure
The project contains the same structure as the second project one (available here: https://github.com/Gabry147/introsde-2017-assignment-2-server). The package names are changed in agreement with assigment specifications.
Only the service package is changed: the _resources_ REST package is replaced with the _SOAP_ package, which contains the SOAP interface and its implementation.
For deploying the application as a SOAP server in Heroku, the WEB-INF folder in WebContent folder has also a _sun-jaxws.xml_ as described in this guide: http://www.mkyong.com/webservices/jax-ws/deploy-jax-ws-web-services-on-tomcat/

## The code logic
The code is based on the second assignment, but the persistency doesn't work without raising a understandable problem, so it needed a strong refactoring:
- the _ivy.xml_ file contains also a Eclipselink implementation for JPA
- the entities fields are all changed to a Class (e.g. int to Integer) and they are all required by the XML schema using the @XmlElement(required = true) attribute.

## How to run the code
> For security reason, the persistence.xml file does not contain the data of the db used. If you want to use this code in a real life scenario, remember to modify it

The server is packed into a .WAR file, automatically generated by Ant with the console command:
``` 
$ ant create.war 
```
